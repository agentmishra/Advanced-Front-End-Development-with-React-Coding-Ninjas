What is the correct output of the given code.
var x='6';
try {
    console.log("Before throw statement");
    if(isNaN(x)) throw "is not a number";
    x = Number(x);

  }
  finally {
    console.log("I am in finally!");
  }
ans: Before throw statement Error caught: is too high I am in finally!.
Solution Description
x is a string but it is a Number so, NaN will return false and then x is converted into a number. Since, it is greater than 5 it throws an error “is too high” and the next cole.log statement does not get executed. Error is caught and a message is displayed. Then control goes to the finally keyword and then "I am in finally!" gets printed.
