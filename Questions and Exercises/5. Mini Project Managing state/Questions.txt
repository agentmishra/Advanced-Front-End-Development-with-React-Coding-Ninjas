1. What happens when you call setState() inside render() method ?
ans: Stack Overflow Error.
Call to setState() invokes render(). Calling it inside render is suicidal. It gets into an infinite loop.

2. Predict the output of following code when the initial value of number is 1 in state, and user tries to invoke the following function on click of a button


handleClick = () => {
    this.setState({ number: 2 }, () => console.log(this.state.number));
    this.setState({ number: 3 }, () => console.log(this.state.number));
}
ans: 3 3
Solution Description
When setState is called multiple times it is batched together and re render happens only once.
The callbacks for both setStates will be fired after re render.

3. Predict the value of this.state.number after the click listener is invoked once and the initial value of number is 1 in state


    handleClick = () => {
        this.setState(
            prevState => {
                return {
                number: prevState.number + 2
                };
            }
        );
        this.setState(
            prevState => {
                return {
                number: prevState.number + 3
                };
            }
        );
    };
ans: 6
explanation: here we are using prevState, which remembers the last updated value, so here there will be no batching.

5. Predict the value of this.state.number after the click listener is invoked once and the initial value of number is 1 in state
Predict the output of the following code when the initial value of number is 1 in state
   handleClick = () => {
      this.setState(
          prevState => {
              return {
                  number: prevState.number + 2
              };
          },
          () => {
              console.log(this.state.number);
          }
      );

      this.setState(
          prevState => {
              return {
                  number: prevState.number + 3
              };
          },
          () => {
              console.log(this.state.number);
          }
      );
  };


ans: 6 6 
the callbacks console.log are called on updated values.

6. setState calls
Send Feedback
The state in react can be updated by call to setState method. These calls are
ans: Asynchronous in nature. 
Solution Description
Call to setState in react is asynchronous in nature and multiple calls can be batched for better performance.

7. Updating state
Send Feedback
Why we should not update the state directly and use setState?
ans: It wont re-render the component

8. What is the purpose of using callbacks in setState?
ans: 
Solution Description
The callback function is invoked when setState is finished and the component gets rendered. Since setState() is asynchronous the callback function is used for any post action.

Note: In the upcoming lecture you will also learn about lifecycle methods that can be used instead of callbacks.
