Which of the following problem was not resolved in the previous video?
ans: Newly added post was not visible as soon as it was added. 
Solution Description
New posts should be added to the and setPosts function should be called so that the whole UI automatically gets rerendered after a new post is added. So, we will make this post global in the next video.

What is Context?
ans: Solution Description
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree

For example, authenticated user, locale preference, UI theme need to be accessed in the application by many components.
     
    const {Provider, Consumer} = React.createContext(defaultValue)

<ul>
      {results.map((user) => (
        <li
          className={styles.searchResultsRow}
        >
          <Link to={`/user/${user._id}`}>

              src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/2154/2154651.svg"
              alt="user"
            />
            <span>{user.name}</span>
          </Link>
        </li>
      ))}
</ul>
ans: Key is missing. 
Solution Description
Key is not present as one of the props. So, it will show a warning. Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity. Keys used within arrays should be unique among their siblings.

    

          {results.map((user) => (
            

              
                user
                {user.name}
              
            

          ))}
